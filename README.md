This is an automatic login system for the LMS, designed for KAIST Gifted Education Center students. 
It automatically logs into the KAIST CCE student LMS site as soon as the computer starts up, then shuts down after completion and displays a confirmation window.

### Installation
	1.	Go to “release” (on the right side) and download the .zip file.
	2.	Extract the file to your desktop or any location of your choice (note: it won’t work if deleted!).
	3.	Open the folder and edit the `id.txt` and `pw.txt` files by entering your ID and password.
	4.	Save everything.
	5.	To check if it’s working properly, run `KAIST_LMS_AutoLogin.exe` and see if a “login completed” window appears.
	6.	If confirmed, close everything, and proceed to the following important steps.
	7.	Right-click `KAIST_LMS_AutoLogin.exe` and select `“Create shortcut”` from the Properties menu.
	8.	Press `Win+R`, type it. 
	```bash
	shell:startup
	```
	9.	Place the shortcut file you just created into that folder.
	10.	Close everything, and you’re done!
